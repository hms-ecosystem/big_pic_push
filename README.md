1. Install Android Studio on your computer. Use Android Studio to open the project-level **build.gradle** file of the sample code.  
2. Create an app in AppGallery Connect and configure the app information. For details, please refer to [Configuring App Information in AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/config-agc-0000001050033072?ha_source=hms1).

4. Import the demo to Android Studio 3.0 or later and build the demo.  
5. Configure the sample code:  
* Download the **agconnect-services.json** file of your app from AppGallery Connect, and add the file to the app-level directory of the demo.  
* Add the signing certificate and add configurations to the app-level **build.gradle** file.  
* Open the AndroidManifest file and change the package name to your app package name.  
* Replace **xxxxx.xxx or xxxxx** in the app-level build.gradle(line 30/31/32/33) with your own file, keyAlias, keyPassword and storePasssords.
